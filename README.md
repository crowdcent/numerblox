# NumerBlox

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

`numerblox` offers Numerai specific functionality, so you can worry less
about software/data engineering and focus more on building great Numerai
models!

Most of the components in this library are designed for solid daily
inference pipelines, but tools like
[`NumerFrame`](https://crowdcent.github.io/numerblox/numerframe.html#numerframe),
preprocessors and evaluators also greatly simplify the training process.

## 1. Install

## 1. Getting Started

**This document has been generated by
[NBDev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev).** Please edit
`nbs/index.ipynb` instead of this `README.md`. Read `CONTRIBUTING.MD`
for more information on the contribution process and how to change
files. Thank you!

### 1.1 Installation

Install numerblox from PyPi by running:

`pip install numerblox`

Alternatively you can clone this repository and install it in
development mode running the following from the root of the repository:

`pip install -e .`

### 1.2 Running Notebooks

Test your installation using one of the education notebooks in
`nbs/edu_nbs`. A good example is `numerframe_tutorial`. Run it in your
Notebook environment to quickly test if your installation has succeeded.

### 2.1. Contents

#### 2.1.1. Core functionality

`numerblox` features the following functionality:

1.  Downloading data
2.  A custom data structure extending Pandas DataFrame
    ([`NumerFrame`](https://crowdcent.github.io/numerblox/numerframe.html#numerframe))
3.  A suite of preprocessors for Numerai Classic and Signals (feature
    selection, engineering and manipulation)
4.  A suite of postprocessors for Numerai Classic and Signals
    (ensembling, neutralization and penalization)
5.  Evaluation
    ([`NumeraiClassicEvaluator`](https://crowdcent.github.io/numerblox/evaluation.html#numeraiclassicevaluator)
    and
    [`NumeraiSignalsEvaluator`](https://crowdcent.github.io/numerblox/evaluation.html#numeraisignalsevaluator))
6.  Submitting
    ([`NumeraiClassicSubmitter`](https://crowdcent.github.io/numerblox/submission.html#numeraiclassicsubmitter),
    [`NumeraiSignalsSubmitter`](https://crowdcent.github.io/numerblox/submission.html#numeraisignalssubmitter)
    and
    [`NumerBaySubmitter`](https://crowdcent.github.io/numerblox/submission.html#numerbaysubmitter))

#### 2.1.2. Educational notebooks

Example notebooks can be found in the `examples` directory.

### 2.2. Examples

Below we will illustrate a common use case for inference pipelines. To
learn more in-depth about the features of this library, check out
notebooks in `examples`.

#### 2.2.1. Numerai Classic

``` python
# --- 0. Numerblox dependencies ---
from numerblox.download import NumeraiClassicDownloader
from numerblox.numerframe import create_numerframe
from numerblox.postprocessing import FeatureNeutralizer
from numerblox.model import SingleModel
from numerblox.model_pipeline import ModelPipeline
from numerblox.key import Key
from numerblox.submission import NumeraiClassicSubmitter

# --- 1. Download version 4.2 data ---
downloader = NumeraiClassicDownloader("data")
downloader.download_inference_data("current_round")

# --- 2. Initialize NumerFrame (optional) ---
dataf = create_numerframe(file_path="data/current_round/live.parquet")

# --- 3. Define and run pipeline. ---
# All numerblox pre- and postprocessors are compatible with scikit-learn
result_dataf = ...

# --- 4. Submit ---
# Set credentials
key = Key(pub_id="Hello", secret_key="World")
submitter = NumeraiClassicSubmitter(directory_path="sub_current_round", key=key)
# full_submission checks contents, saves as csv and submits.
submitter.full_submission(dataf=result_dataf,
                          cols=f"prediction_test_neutralized_0.5",
                          model_name="test")

# --- 5. Clean up environment (optional) ---
downloader.remove_base_directory()
submitter.remove_base_directory()
```

#### 2.2.2. Numerai Signals

``` python
# --- 0. Numerblox dependencies ---
from numerblox.download import KaggleDownloader
from numerblox.numerframe import create_numerframe
from numerblox.preprocessing import KatsuFeatureGenerator
from numerblox.model import SingleModel
from numerblox.model_pipeline import ModelPipeline
from numerblox.key import Key
from numerblox.submission import NumeraiSignalsSubmitter

# --- 1. Download Katsu1110 yfinance dataset from Kaggle ---
kd = KaggleDownloader("data")
kd.download_inference_data("code1110/yfinance-stock-price-data-for-numerai-signals")

# --- 2. Initialize NumerFrame (optional) ---
dataf = create_numerframe("data/full_data.parquet")

# --- 3. Define and run pipeline ---
# All numerblox pre- and postprocessors are compatible with scikit-learn
result_dataf = ...

# --- 4. Submit ---
# Set credentials
key = Key(pub_id="Hello", secret_key="World")
submitter = NumeraiSignalsSubmitter(directory_path="sub_current_round", key=key)
# full_submission checks contents, saves as csv and submits.
# cols selection must at least contain 1 ticker column and a signal column.
submitter.full_submission(dataf=result_dataf,
                          cols=['bloomberg_ticker', 'signal'],
                          model_name="test_model1")

# --- 5. Clean up environment (optional) ---
kd.remove_base_directory()
submitter.remove_base_directory()
```
