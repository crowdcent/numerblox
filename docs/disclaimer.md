Under no circumstances should any information provided in this software — or on associated distribution outlets — be construed as an offer soliciting the purchase or sale of any security or interest in any pooled investment vehicle sponsored, discussed, or mentioned by CrowdCent LLC or affiliates. Nor should it be construed as an offer to provide investment advisory services; an offer to invest in a CrowdCent investment vehicle will be made separately and only by means of the confidential offering documents of the specific pooled investment vehicles — which should be read in their entirety, and only to those who, among other requirements, meet certain qualifications under federal securities laws. Such investors, defined as accredited investors and qualified purchasers, are generally deemed capable of evaluating the merits and risks of prospective investments and financial matters. There can be no assurances that CrowdCent’s investment objectives will be achieved or investment strategies will be successful. Any investment in a vehicle managed by CrowdCent involves a high degree of risk including the risk that the entire amount invested is lost. Any investments or portfolio companies mentioned, referred to, or described are not representative of all investments in vehicles managed by CrowdCent and there can be no assurance that the investments will be profitable or that other investments made in the future will have similar characteristics or results.
